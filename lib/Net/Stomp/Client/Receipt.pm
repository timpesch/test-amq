=head1 NAME

Net::STOMP::Client::Receipt - Receipt support for Net::STOMP::Client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::STOMP::Client;
  $stomp = Net::STOMP::Client->new(host => "127.0.0.1", port => 61613);
  ...
  # send two messages with receipts
  $stomp->send(
      destination => "/queue/test1",
      body        => "message 1",
      receipt     => $stomp->uuid(),
  );
  $stomp->send(
      destination => "/queue/test2",
      body        => "message 2",
      receipt     => $stomp->uuid(),
  );
  # wait for both acknowledgments to come back within ten seconds
  $stomp->wait_for_receipts(timeout => 10);
  die("Not all receipts received!\n") if $stomp->receipts();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module eases receipts handling. It is used internally by
L<Net::STOMP::Client> and should not be directly used elsewhere.

Each time a client frame is sent, its C<receipt> header (if supplied) is
remembered.

Each time a C<RECEIPT> frame is received from the server, the corresponding
receipt is ticked off.

The receipts() method can be used to get the list of outstanding receipts.

The wait_for_receipts() method can be used to wait for all missing receipts.

=head1 METHODS

This module provides the following methods to L<Net::STOMP::Client>:

=over

=item receipts()

get the list of not-yet-received receipts

=item wait_for_receipts([OPTIONS])

wait for all receipts to be received, using wait_for_frames() underneath;
take the same options as wait_for_frames(), except C<callback> which is
overridden

=back
